What is a Content Delivery Network (CDN)?  List and explain at least FOUR advantages in using a CDN.

A content delivery network is a service that spreads the files for a website across multiple servers in multiple locations. Four advantages to CDNs are:
1- Speed: more servers to handle more load
2- Location: Servers are located in regions cloest to the people they are serving
3- Scalability: The network can grow dynamically if more requests start hitting the network just like a cloud instance.
4- Reliability: The website files are stored on multiple servers in multiple locations so if something like a natural disaster strikes, your site stays up.
