<h1><b>Assignment Description:</b></h1>

In this exercise, you will be building an application that displays a displays the elements containing a recipe’s <b>ingredients</b> and <b>instructions</b> when a user clicks the associated headers. You will use jQuery to respond to the users’ requests.  Figure 1, below, is a preview of the recipe display application you will create.

<h1><b>Background</b></h1>
Developers often find themselves reusing code they originally wrote for a different project. The many lines of code that acommplish a specific task can often be generalized to the point that they can be copied and inserted in another project with few if any changes. Individual programmers and organizations have long compiled such useful sets of code into JavaScript libraries, which they can link to new projects to use any code the libraries contain. In addition to such private libraries, a number of free, publicly available libraries are also in common use on the web today. One of the most commonly used is jQuery, which is the library that enables developers to implement many common JavaScript tasks with minimal code.

<b><h1>jQuery Advantages</h1></b>
jQuery removes some of the tedious work from coding JavaScrfipt and also provides a shortcut from some of the complicated parts of writing JavaScript. For starters, jQuery is a cross-browser library, automatically including alternate code where necessary to support different browsers.

The jQuery Foundation, which maintains the jQuery library, publishes and supports many versions of jQuery:  jQuery 1.x and jQuery 2.x.  The first, jQuery 1.x , is backward compatible with Internet Explorer version 6 and later; meaning it supports IE 6,7, and 8.  By contrast, jQuery 2.x does not support these older versions of IE, but instead supports only IE 9 and later.
